> Research and education, a dual vessel, I care deeply about, and I enjoy communicating my work and experience with different audiences.

> Creativity is the main drive of everything I do, from conception and implementation to delivery and reflection.
> 
> Teamwork and the growth this can lead to the group and each member is also one of the processes I enjoy, and would gladly take up leadership in topics I am interrested in, equally with following others and make contributions towards a common endeavor. 

> I am keen in combining materials modelling tools with experimental techniques to develop our understanding on high-performance materials and / devices. I am interested in the optimisation of manufacturing processes and the design and development of new alloys with direct applications in a range of fields spanning from aerospace and automotive to energy storage technologies and other electronic devices or to answer fundamental research questions, such as the origin of Dark Matter.

I am a materials scientist with experience in both structural and functional materials. My expertise in thermodynamics and kinetics of surface reactions and bulk diffusion at the mesoscale, through materials modelling & experimental validation, is key for optimising industrial processing and the development of new alloys. I have developed models, using the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) framework, to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of elemental surface sublimation and vapour deposition (i.e. grain growth) on the surface of metallic alloys, which consist of 10 major elements. These are directly linked to applications in manufacturing challenges such as oxidation and surface melting, as well as in additive manufacturing techniques and coatings.

After receiving my degree in Materials Science & Engineering from the University of Ioannina, Greece, I completed the MSc at Sustainable Energy Systems in 2013, at the University of Edinburgh before starting my PhD project in the School of Metallurgy & Materials, University of Birmingham. I collaborated with Rolls-Royce plc on the industrial challenges of single crystal Ni-based superalloys, during investment casting and heat treatments. This collaboration was further strengthened in my role as Casting Development Research Fellow for the High Temperature Research Centre (HTRC). I developed physics-based models for surface reactions on metallic substrates of multi-component alloys. These improved our understanding on mechanisms such as elemental surface sublimation, physical vapour deposition and high temperature oxidation of single crystal Ni-based superalloys.

I joined the Particle Physics group following a period with the Energy Materials Group in the University of Birmingham, as a member of Faraday Institution. In the context of the Multi-scale Modelling (MSM) project I focused on the thermodynamic, kinetic and physical parameters for the development of physics-based multi-scale battery models.

I have been awarded a UKRI Fellowship (Horizon Europe Guarantee), initially awarded as a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Global Post-doctoral Fellowship. The _PureAlloys_ project aims at the development of new ultra-pure, high-strength, electroformed CuCr alloys for the next generation detectors for rare event searches (e.g. Dark Matter).

Within the _PureAlloys_ project, I am developing my expertise on electrolyte-electrode (metallic) interfaces, in collaboration with Particle Physicists and Chemists. This directly links to my interest on the evolution of materials thermodynamic, kinetic and electrochemical properties during processes that involve interfaces.
