The _PureAlloys_ project will advance our understanding in the nature of the Cosmos by enabling novel, extremely radiopure, experimental searches for Dark Matter and for neutrinoless double beta decay. 

Current experiments are constrained by radioactive contamination in the detector manufacturing process, posing the main barrier in their physics discovery potential. Electroformed copper achieves extreme radiopurity, however it is limited by its mechanical properties: high ductility and low strength.

_PureAlloys_ will address this challenge by designing high radiopurity CuCr and CuCrTi alloys with significantly higher strength. A novel multi-scale modelling framework enabling fast progress in designing application-specific alloys will be developed, opening the path for the design of new alloys in fields involving fabrication and properties enhancement where the thermodynamic and kinetic description of the system is crucial. _PureAlloys_ will push the boundaries in many fields: from fundamental science to industrial applications.

In the first publication of _PureAlloys_ {% cite SPATHARA2026170970 %}, simulations using computational thermodynamics are compared with experimental data for the first time. 

> A study to predict mechanical enhancement with temporal predictions of solid solution and precipitation strengthening during solution heat treatment and aging is also included.
> A data-driven methodology to design novel radiopure materials for detector systems is proposed. 

Many thanks for the time and support I received from the Birmingham Particle Physics group, namely Kostas Nikolopoulos and Patrick Knights and the world-expert in developing radiopure materials Eric W Hoppe. Our discussions had a massive impact in shaping this endeavour!

Our contribution {% cite spathara2025materials %} to the special collection _The Direct Detection of Dark Matter in the Underground Laboratory: Past, Present, and Future Prospects, for WIMPs and Non-WIMP Candidates_, demonstrates the suggested methodology for designing the Cr/Cu,  Cr/Ti and Cr-Ti/Cu layer configurations to achieve homogenized alloys of Cu-0.5Cr and Cu-0.5-0.038Ti (in wt%) composition using electroformation. It also discusses the challenges of manufacturing radiopure CuCr and CuCrTi alloys. 

> The impact of such alloys to the direct Dark Matter detection and other rare event searches to answer fundamental research questions is demonstrated by two case studies concerning the DarkSPHERE project and the future experiment XLZD.
> This work leads the way to the next steps of _PureAlloys_.
