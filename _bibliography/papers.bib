  abstract={Direct Dark Matter detection and studies on the nature of neutrinos demand detector systems with extremely low background levels, including from radioactivity. Additive-free, electroformed copper, in addition to a set of advantages, exhibits exceptional radiopurity, making it the material of choice for mechanical and structural components for rare-event searches experiments. To satisfy the increasing demand for materials with superior mechanical strength, the development of copper–chromium alloys is pursued. Early investigations explored the synthesis of these alloys by electrodeposition and thermal processing. A materials-design approach is proposed to optimize the fabrication and thermal processing stages of manufacturing. It is assisted by materials modeling tools based on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of alloy compositions, which enables faster development of novel materials by predicting properties and materials performance. This approach is demonstrated by comparing simulations with previously reported experimental investigations and proposing improved thermal processing.}

  abstract={Spherical proportional counters (SPCs) are gaseous particle detectors sensitive to single ionization electrons in their target media, with large detector volumes and low background rates. The NEWS-G collaboration employs this technology to search for low-mass dark matter, having previously performed searches with detectors at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM), including a recent campaign with a 135 cm diameter SPC filled with methane. While in situ calibrations of the detector response were carried out at the LSM, measurements of the mean ionization yield and fluctuations of methane gas in SPCs were performed using a 30 cm diameter detector. The results of multiple measurements taken at different operating voltages are presented. A UV laser system was used to measure the mean gas gain of the SPC, along with 37 Ar and aluminum-fluorescence calibration sources. These measurements will inform the energy response model of future operating detectors.}

New results from a 10 day physics run with a 135 cm in diameter spherical proportional counter at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane are reported. The target consists of 114 g of methane, providing sensitivity to dark matter spin-dependent coupling to protons. New constraints are presented in the mass range 0.17 to 1.2  GeV/c2, with a 90% confidence level cross-section upper limit of 30.9 pb for a mass of 0.76  GeV/c2.}

  abstract={The cell balance, negative to positive (N:P) electrode ratio, and voltage limits determine the first cycle loss and reversible capacity at different rates and can influence degradation mechanisms and cycle life. This balance needs optimizing for each cell chemistry, electrode mass loading, and cell format, typically performed through empirical optimization. This work provides an accurate predictive tool for calculating full-cell voltages by decoupling the independent electrode potential under the same operating conditions. Full-cell NMC622//Graphite voltages are accurately predicted from low-rate half-cell voltage profiles (pseudo-open circuit voltages) and validated for different N:P ratios, rates, material types, and cell formats. The application of this methodology to several chemistries, including sodium-ion cell chemistry, high power (NMC622//MoNb12O33), and high energy (NMC920305//Graphite-SiOx), is also demonstrated. In addition, each electrode's key thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are extracted from the observed voltage and overpotentials for the negative and positive electrodes at different rates. Elucidating the rate-limiting electrodes and providing further cell balancing information to achieve high power, energy, and lifetime. The extracted parameters can be used in multi-scale models to optimise cell design and performance limitations further. This method promises new and quicker routes for cell optimization for different chemistries and formats.}

  abstract={This work investigates the mechanism of surface modifications on the Re-rich single crystal superalloys CMSX-10N and CMSX-10K due to elemental sublimation. When the alloys surface is exposed at high temperatures, mainly during solution heat treatment, modifications occur on the surface layers. Observations and characterisation analysis shows polycrystalline layers of γ' matrix with precipitates of TCP phases on a single crystal substrate, rich in γ forming elements. It is found that they become more pronounced at high temperatures and for longer exposure time. Thermodynamic studies with the method of Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry were performed. The activities of Ni, Co, Cr and Al were determined, leading to the thermodynamic description of the reaction of elemental sublimation of these four species when in equilibrium. A model has been developed to predict the microstructural evolution on the surface modified layers, for specific exposure time, at a given temperature with the CALPHAD type thermodynamic and kinetic databases. The model was validated with experimental measurements and observations. The results were compared with simulations on the CMSX-4 and the newly developed CMSX-4®Plus. Lastly, the reverse process; i.e. vapour deposition instead of elemental sublimation was studied for the CMSX-10K alloy during a 24-hour heat treatment at 1350°C. After this heat treatment, observations did not show any TCP phases forming on the surface layer.}

  abstract={A third-generation single-crystal (SX) superalloy was heat treated at 1350 °C for 24 hours while being exposed to nickel vapor. It is observed that a layer of 60-µm thickness deposited onto the alloy. This prevented the formation of TCP phases and the occurrence of melting, which were reported in previous studies. The interdiffusion between the alloy and deposited layer shows strong indications of cross-diffusion effects, as shown from the composition profile measurements and simulations.}
