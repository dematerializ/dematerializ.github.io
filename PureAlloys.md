This is a webpage containing information abou the PureAlloys project I am working since 2023.

The _PureAlloys_ project will advance our understanding in the nature of the Cosmos by enabling novel, extremely radiopure,
experimental searches for Dark Matter and for neutrinoless double beta decay. Current experiments are constrained by radioactive
contamination in the detector manufacturing process, posing the main barrier in their physics discovery potential. Electroformed
copper achieves extreme radiopurity, however it is limited by its mechanical properties: high ductility and low strength. _PureAlloys_
will address this challenge by designing high radiopurity CuCr and CuCrTi alloys with significantly higher strength. A novel multi-scale
modelling framework enabling fast progress in designing application-specific alloys will be developed, opening the path for the
design of new alloys in fields involving fabrication and properties enhancement where the thermodynamic and kinetic description of
the system is crucial. _PureAlloys_ will push the boundaries in many fields: from fundamental science to industrial applications.
